<p><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe feeds 2. You may also work with any fish similar to milkfish, like pompano and sea bass.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium milkfish (approx. 250g), boneless and butterflied</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, diced</li>
        <li>500mL white vinegar</li>
        <li>Black pepper, crushed</li>
        <li>Fine salt</li>
        <li>100mL vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow casserole, pour in the vinegar, garlic, and pinches of black pepper and salt.</li>
        <li>Place the fish in the casserole and bathe in the vinegar mix. Let it marinate, flesh facing down, for 20 minutes. <strong>Do not marinate for longer to prevent the fish from becoming mushy.</strong></li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan on medium heat. Fry the fish, starting with the skin down.</li>
        <li>Once the skin turns crispy and golden brown, flip it until flesh is golden brown, around 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with white rice and a dipping sauce of soy sauce and <i lang="en">calamansi</i> or lime...and, of course, an ice-cold glass of Coke.</li>
    </ol>
