<p><strong>Note:</strong> This recipe feeds 2. You may also substitute the pork for beef, fish, chicken, or shrimpâ€”or omit it and the fish sauce altogether to make it vegetarian. However, remember to adjust the cooking time accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g pork belly, boneless, cut cross-wise into 3-inch chunks</li>
        <li>250g water spinach, leaves and stems separated</li>
        <li>2 large red onions, quartered</li>
        <li>3 large tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>3 Tagalog chili peppers, whole</li>
        <li>1 pack 44g Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original</li>
        <li>20mL fish sauce</li>
        <li>2L water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Throw the pork belly, onions, and tomatoes in and continue to boil with the lid closed.</li>
        <li>Skim any scum off the surface of the boiling water to prevent cloudiness.</li>
        <li>When the pork is halfway tender, add the fish sauce and half of the Sinigang Mix. <em>Partially cover the pot</em> to prevent foaming. Add water as needed.</li>
        <li>Once the pork is tender, add the chili peppers and water spinach stalks. Add more Sinigang Mix for additional sourness and fish sauce for saltiness to taste. Boil for 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off, add the water spinach leaves, fully cover the pot, and rest for 5 minutes. Serve with white rice.</li>
    </ol>
