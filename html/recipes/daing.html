    <div class="recipe-description"></div>
        <p><i lang="tl">Daing</i> is a traditional Filipino dish with deep cultural roots reflecting the country's resourcefulness and coastal heritage.</p>
        <p>The term <i lang="tl">"daing"</i> generally refers to fish that has been split open, salted, and dried under the sun. This preservation method has been practiced in the Philippines for centuries, dating back to pre-colonial times, when communities relied on salting and drying as essential ways to extend the shelf life of fresh catch in a tropical climate. For fishing villages and inland areas alike, <i lang="tl">daing</i> became a practical solution that allowed families to store protein for longer periods, especially during lean fishing seasons or storms that limited access to fresh seafood.</p>
        <p>Beyond its practicality, the dish holds cultural significance as a food tied to daily life and regional identity. Different provinces have their own preferred fish varieties for <i lang="tl">daing</i>, such as <i lang="tl">bangus</i> (milkfish), <i lang="tl">danggit</i> (rabbitfish), or <i lang="tl">galunggong</i> (round scad), creating subtle distinctions in taste and tradition. In coastal towns, preparing and selling daing also became part of the local economy, with dried fish markets serving as community hubs.</p>
        <p><i lang="tl">Daing</i> carries strong associations with Filipino breakfast culture, where it is often enjoyed with garlic rice and eggsâ€”a combination popularly known as <i lang="tl">daing-silog</i>. It is also remembered fondly by Filipinos abroad, as its distinct aroma and flavor evoke nostalgia for home. Despite its humble origins, <i lang="tl">daing</i> has retained its place in both everyday meals and culinary memory, symbolizing the Filipino ability to preserve not just food, but tradition and identity across generations.</p>

                <li>In a shallow casserole, pour in the vinegar, garlic, and pinches of black pepper and salt.</li>
                <li>Place the fish in the casserole and bathe in the vinegar mix. Let it marinate, flesh facing down, for 20 minutes. <strong>Do not marinate for longer to prevent the fish from becoming mushy.</strong></li>

                <li>Once the skin turns crispy and golden brown, flip it until flesh is golden brown, around 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with white rice and a dipping sauce of soy sauce and <i lang="en">calamansi</i> or lime...and, of course, an ice-cold glass of Coke.</li>
